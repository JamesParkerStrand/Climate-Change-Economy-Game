# Climate-Change-Economy-Game
part of a group project I am doing for computer science/ individual political science assignment on a public service on climate change. note: heavy w.i.p, expect to see something fully functioning soon!

look at playerinterfaceJames for the game loop!

UPDATE ** added decision to do tax loop or not, just to add an impression of what the game will do throughout the whole thing, and that will act as one of the random choices happening throughout the game **
